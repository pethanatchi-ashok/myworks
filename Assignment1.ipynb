    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",

    "---------\n",
    "Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.\n",
    "*Integers – Represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.\n",
    "*Float – Represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.\n",
    "*Complex Numbers – Represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. In Python, imaginary part notation is j.For example – 2+3j\n",
    "\n",
    "2)String\n",
    "--------\n",
    "Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.\n",
    "Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.\n",
    "Eg : \n",
    "\tstr1 = \"Pethanatchi\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3)List\n",
    "------\n",
    "Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "To access the list items refer to the index number. Use the index operator [ ] to access an item in a list. In Python, negative sequence indexes represent positions from the end of the array. Instead of having to compute the offset as in List[len(List)-3], it is enough to just write List[-3]. Negative indexing means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second-last item, etc.\n",
    "Eg :\n",
    "\tlist1=[\"Peth\",123,4.5,True]\n",

    "4)Tuple\n",
    "-------\n",
    "Tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by tuple class.\n",
    "Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, list, etc.).\n",
    "Eg :\n",
